-->How to Run the Project
Make sure Java (JDK) is installed on your system.
Clone the repository:
git clone (https://github.com/Rajsinha7/Car-Rental-System-using-Java)
Navigate to the project directory:
cd car-rental-system
Compile the Java files:
javac *.java
Run the application:
java CarRentalSystem

--> How It Works
Car class stores car details and availability
Customer class manages customer information
Rental class handles rental duration and cost calculation

CarRentalSystem acts as the main controller class

The system uses OOP principles to ensure modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
